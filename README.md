A web app which converts a Spotify playlist into a Youtube playlist. Made possible using the Spotify API and the YouTube API. There are a few playlist manipulation features on the interface including shuffling songs, removing songs, clearing all songs and adding custom songs. This app was created for my Computer Science A-Level coursework. Built with React.js and Passport.js for authentication.
